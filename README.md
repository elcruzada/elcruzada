### Hi there ðŸ‘‹. I'm a full-stack software engineer. Let us connect!

The allure of software engineering lies in the power to create. It serves as an outlet for my creative bent and enables me to engage in logical problem-solving. Whether it is crafting frontend features or developing intricate backend routes, there is a distinct joy of building something tangible from lines of code.

I am eager to embrace the challenges that lie ahead, knowing that each experience will be a stepping stone toward continuous growth and learning. Above all, I am driven by the prospect of acquiring new knowledge, honing my skills, and making a meaningful impact in the world of technology. Software engineering is a thread that weaves together my excitement for creation, my proficiency in communication, and my unwavering eagerness for continuous learning as well as personal and professional growth.

Beyond coding, reading poetry and writing poetry is my main mode of artistic expression. I also love to travel and spent nearly four years abroad working as an ESL teacher and writer. My other interests include chess, board games, and video games. One day, I want to get a scuba diving license.

If you are looking for someone who is driven, motivated, and creative, Iâ€™d love to get in touch at efren.laya.cruzada@gmail.com
