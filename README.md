### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--

As a writer, I had a knack for words. Words are my tools, and through them, I could convey thoughts, feelings, and ideas. Still, there was always a part of me that yearned to create things and be part of the ever-evolving world of technology. This led me to wanting to write for cryptocurrency media companies. However, as close as this got me to technology, I further wanted to contribute to its future.

Recognizing this and the more it gnawed on me, I embarked on a mission to learn programming and commit to it fully. As I began my software engineering journey, I applied and was accepted to App Academy. The decision to join such an intensive program was driven by a desire to understand programming and actively contribute to the technological advances I had previously been writing about. I wanted to go beyond observing and reporting; I wanted to be a hands-on participant in the technologies of our era.

The allure of software engineering lies in the power to create. It serves as an outlet for my creative bent and enables me to engage in logical problem-solving. Whether it is crafting frontend features or developing intricate backend routes, there is a distinct joy of building something tangible from lines of code.

I am eager to embrace the challenges that lie ahead, knowing that each experience will be a stepping stone toward continuous growth and learning. Above all, I am driven by the prospect of acquiring new knowledge, honing my skills, and making a meaningful impact in the world of technology. Software engineering is a thread that weaves together my excitement for creation, my proficiency in communication, and my unwavering eagerness for continuous learning as well as personal and professional growth.

Beyond coding, reading poetry and writing poetry is my main mode of artistic expression. I also love to travel and spent nearly four years abroad working as an ESL teacher and writer. My other interests include chess, board games, and video games. One day, I want to get a scuba diving license.
